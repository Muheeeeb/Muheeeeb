## About

AI engineer with a gold medal in Artificial Intelligence and hands-on experience shipping full-stack products to production. I build across the entire stack — from training deep learning models to deploying web and mobile applications that real users depend on.

My work spans e-commerce platforms serving live customers, delivery systems handling real-time logistics, and ML pipelines processing production data. I focus on building things that work at scale, not just in notebooks.
